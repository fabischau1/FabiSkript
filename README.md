3. Grant of Patent License.
   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.
   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
   (1) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The parties acknowledge that this License is not intended to create any third-party beneficiary rights. The Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time.
